# GitHub Release Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your GitHub Actions workflows are now configured and ready to automatically build and release Proxmon binaries.

## What Was Created

### 1. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
**Triggers:** When you push a git tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`)

**Builds:**
- macOS Intel (x86_64)
- macOS Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- Linux with glibc (standard)
- Linux with musl (statically linked, universal)
- Windows (x86_64)

**Features:**
- Automatic GitHub Release creation
- SHA-256 checksums for all binaries
- Strips binaries to reduce size
- Nice release notes with installation instructions

### 2. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main`/`develop` branches, or pull requests

**Runs:**
- Tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- Tests with stable and beta Rust
- Format checking with `cargo fmt`
- Linting with `clippy`
- Documentation build check
- Build verification for all platforms
- Caching for faster builds

## How to Use

### First Release

```bash
# 1. Make sure everything is committed and pushed
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin main

# 2. Create and push a tag
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# 3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Create a release
#    - Build for 5 platforms
#    - Upload binaries with checksums
#    - Takes ~10-15 minutes
```

### Watch Progress

1. Go to: https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/actions
2. Click on the "Release" workflow
3. Watch the builds progress
4. When done, check: https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases

### Test on Your Linux Machine

After the release completes:

```bash
# On your Linux machine
curl -L https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases/download/v0.1.0/proxmon-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x proxmon
./proxmon
```

Or use the MUSL build (works on ANY Linux):
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases/download/v0.1.0/proxmon-linux-x86_64-musl.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x proxmon
./proxmon
```

## Future Releases

For subsequent releases:

```bash
# 1. Update version in Cargo.toml
vim Cargo.toml  # Change version = "0.1.1"

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new features

# 3. Commit changes
git add Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Bump version to v0.1.1"
git push origin main

# 4. Tag and release
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1

# Done! Workflow handles the rest.
```

## What Users Will See

### On GitHub Releases
- Pre-compiled binaries for all platforms
- SHA-256 checksums for verification
- Installation instructions
- Release notes

### Download Commands
Users can install with simple curl commands:

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases/latest/download/proxmon-darwin-aarch64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x proxmon
sudo mv proxmon /usr/local/bin/
```

**macOS (Intel):**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases/latest/download/proxmon-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x proxmon
sudo mv proxmon /usr/local/bin/
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/0xgoz/proxmon/releases/latest/download/proxmon-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x proxmon
sudo mv proxmon /usr/local/bin/
```

**Windows:**
Download the `.zip` from releases page, extract, and add to PATH.

## CI Benefits

The CI workflow runs on every push and PR to catch issues early:

âœ… Tests run on 3 operating systems
âœ… Tests with stable and beta Rust
âœ… Code formatting enforced
âœ… Clippy lints catch common issues
âœ… Documentation builds verified
âœ… Builds verified for all platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Actions
If Actions don't run:
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

### Re-run Failed Jobs
Sometimes builds fail due to network issues:
1. Go to the failed workflow run
2. Click "Re-run jobs" â†’ "Re-run failed jobs"

### Delete and Recreate Tag
If you need to fix something:
```bash
# Delete local and remote tag
git tag -d v0.1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0

# Make fixes, commit, then recreate tag
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow:**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Create a v0.1.0 tag
   - Watch it build
   - Test the Linux binary on your machine

2. **Publish to crates.io:**
   ```bash
   cargo login  # Get token from https://crates.io/settings/tokens
   cargo publish
   ```

3. **Announce your release:**
   - Share on relevant communities
   - Update documentation
   - Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
